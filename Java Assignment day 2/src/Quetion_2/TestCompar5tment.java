/*
 * Create an abstract class Compartment to represent a rail coach.
 *  Provide a abstract function notice in this class.
 *   Derive FirstClass, Ladies, General, Luggage classes from the 
 *   compartment class. Override the notice function in each of them 
 *   to print notice suitable to the type of the compartment.

Create a class TestCompartment . Write main function to do 
the following:

Declare an array of Compartment pointers of size 10.

Create a compartment of a type as decided by a randomly
 generated integer in the range 1 to 4.

Check the polymorphic behavior of the notice method.
